#Feature: U37 - View aggregated personal statistics
#
#  Scenario: AC3 - Given I am viewing my profile, When I have statistics for teams. Then I can
#  see my personal aggregated statistics per team for the amount of points I have scored.
#    Given I am logged in
#    And I have a team with a formation
#    And I have added a line up to an activity
#    And I have added a scoring statistic
#    When I click on a UI element to see my profile
#    Then I can see how many points I have scored for that team
